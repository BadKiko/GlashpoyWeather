/**
 * A data class that models the response that would be received when a request to get the current
 * weather of a location is made.
 *
 * Note: All response classes are annotated with @JsonClass in order to make Moshi use code-gen.
 * Making Moshi use code-gen is useful for mainly two reasons:
 * 1) Moshi, by default uses reflection. This creates overhead during runtime. Using code-gen
 * makes moshi take advantage of kapt during compile time. This removes the overhead that is
 * associated with reflection.
 *
 * 2) Using code-gen makes moshi use Kotlin Poet under the hood. This makes moshi generate
 * actual Kotlin classes instead of the Java equivalents of Kotlin classes. This ensures that
 * Moshi fully understands Kotlin constructs. The best example of this, is nullability.
 * When Moshi doesn't use codegen, then non-null properties in Kotlin can be assigned null values!
 * This is because, Moshi generates the Java equivalent of the Kotlin data class.
